# MarsRover

Directions
1) Clone by running: git clone https://github.com/chaheein123/MarsRover.git
2) Start or run the application

Methods:
1) Created 2 classes (Plateau, Rover)
2) Rover is injected into the Plateau class, as the Plateau class is being instantiated
3) The Rover object will be created
4) The user inputs values of the Rover and its instruction on where to land
5) Rover processes the instructions
6) Automatically repeat from step 3 with the help of while loop to simulate Rover coming back and another new Rover going out. Unless the user inputs to quit, Rover will keep getting instantiated
